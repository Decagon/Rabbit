======

Rabbit allows PlayerIO developers to seamlessly integrate all supported types (Armor Games, Kongregate, Mousebreaker, Facebook, email, Yahoo*, and standard authentication) into one login interface. 

Want to use Rabbit in your project? It's simple!

```csharp
Connection conn = new RabbitAuth().LogOn(gameId, email, passwordOrToken);
```


The [PlayerIOClient (v3.0.14)](https://gamesnet.yahoo.com/download/) is a dependency.

###Everybody Edits

Use `EERabbitAuth()` to specifically authenticate with Everybody Edits:


```csharp
Connection conn = new EERabbitAuth().LogOn(EmailOrTokenOrUserName, RoomID, Password);
```

Using this method allows for the room to be joined (or created if one does not exist), has built-in room id verification, and is able to extract the id from url's. However, you may use `RabbitAuth()` instead.
