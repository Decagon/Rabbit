======

Rabbit allows PlayerIO developers to seamlessly integrate all supported types (Armor Games, Kongregate, Mousebreaker, Facebook, email, Yahoo*, and standard authentication) into one login interface. 

Want to use Rabbit in your project? It's simple!

```csharp
Connection conn = new RabbitAuth().LogOn(gameId, email, password);
```


The [PlayerIOClient (v3.0.14)](https://gamesnet.yahoo.com/download/) is a dependency.

```csharp
Connection conn = new EERabbitAuth().LogOn(EmailOrTokenOrUserName, RoomID, Password);
```
